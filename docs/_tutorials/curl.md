---

This is a quick tutorial to help you get started with the SEMP. You can learn more about the SEMP API using the [Online Documentation]({{ site.docs-semp-home }}){:target="_top"}. These documents explain the API concepts and details about the REST API. Additionally developers will find the [SEMP API Reference]({{ site.docs-api }}){:target="_top"} useful in understanding how to apply the concepts in this tutorial to other Solace Message Router objects.

**Note**: This tutorial applies to the SEMP API starting in version 2. For older versions of the SEMP API, you can see the [Legacy SEMP Documentation]({{ site.docs-semp-legacy }}){:target="_top"}

The following examples use `curl` which is a simple command line tool which can easily send HTTP requests and print the response. Most programming languages have readily available libraries for HTTP. It should be easy enough to adapt the examples below to the programming language of your choosing.

Alternatively, it is also possible to use SEMP through a client library. If you are interested in using a client library, you can look at this [Quick Start tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/java-client) which provides steps for generating a client library and using it to make SEMP calls.

**Note**: Currently SEMP v2 is only supported on Solace message router appliances running SolOS version 7.2.2 and above. Solace virtual message router will add SEMP v2 support in the near future.

## Assumptions

The examples below make a few assumptions for simplicity:

* These examples will work with a Client Username object to illustrate the various concepts. The concepts apply generally to all objects in SEMP.
* The SEMP username and password are `user:password`
* The Solace message router host and port are `solacevmr:8080`

## The Basics

Before jumping to a specific method and SEMP resource, let’s just introduce a few basic concepts that common across the API. If you have not already, you can learn more about these concepts and SEMP in general by checking out the [API overview]({{ site.docs-overview }}){:target="_top"}.

Objects in SEMP are represented by JSON. For example, if you want to create a Client Username called `tutorialUser` and enable this Client Username, you can use the following JSON.

```
{
    "clientUsername" : "tutorialUser",
    "enabled" : true
}
```

All Solace message router objects are addressed by a resource path that you specify in the URI. So for example let’s look at the URI for creating a Client Username.

    solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames

In this URI, the authority component is `solacevmr:8080`, which identifies the Solace message router that you are interacting with. Then `/SEMP/v2/config` identifies that you are making a SEMP call and that you are using version 2 of the API `config` API.

The remaining part of the URI, `/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames`, identifies that you are targeting Client Usernames collection within the “default” message-VPN.

Ok let’s get started...

## Creating an object using POST

You create a Client Username from the `clientUsernames` collection within the message-VPN. The Client Username has only one required attribute, its name. In this example I’ve chosen `tutorialUser`. For interest, I will also enable the new Client Username so it is ready for messaging clients to use. During creation, any attributes that are not specified will be created using default values. 

With `curl`, you can create a Client Username using an HTTP POST with the following command:

```
curl -X POST -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientUsername":"tutorialUser","enabled":true}'
```

When you execute this command, if successful the Solace message router will respond with contents that resembles the following:

```
{
    "data":{
        "aclProfileName":"default",
        "clientProfileName":"default",
        "clientUsername":"tutorialUser",
        "enabled":true,
        "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
        "msgVpnName":"default",
        "subscriptionManager":false
    },
    "links":{
        "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
    },
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"POST",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
}
```

The response contains three components. These are explained in more detail in the [API overview]({{ site.docs-overview }}){:target="_top"}. But here is a quick summary:

* Meta – The meta field contains information about the request that was sent, the response code from the Solace message router and it will contain additional error information on failures.
* Links – The links object makes the API self-discoverable which can be nice for developers as they are coding. You can experiment with SEMP objects and use the links to navigate through collections to member objects etc. In general, this is simply a tool to aid in development because at runtime, most configuration management tools and applications follow known patterns and can directly address the resources. There is no need for this discoverability.
* Data – The data contains a full representation of the newly created object. Here you can see what default values were select by the Solace message router etc.

## Retrieving an object using GET

Now that you have created a Client Username, you can retrieve the object using an HTTP GET. The resource path for the `tutorialUser` Client Username created previously would be:

    /msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser

Putting that together with curl, you get the following command:

    curl –X GET -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser

When you retrieve a specific object from SEMP, the response will contain the expected, `meta`, `links`, and `data` fields with the `data` field being the full representation of the object.

```
{
    "data":{
        "aclProfileName":"default",
        "clientProfileName":"default",
        "clientUsername":"tutorialUser",
        "enabled":true,
        "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
        "msgVpnName":"default",
        "subscriptionManager":false
    },
    "links":{
        "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
    },
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"GET",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
}
```

## Retrieving a collection of objects using GET

You can also retrieve all of the Client Usernames within the `default` Message VPN and you will see the newly created `tutorialUser` object as well as any others. For this, you perform an HTTP GET on the actual `clientUsernames` collection.

    curl -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames

In this case, the response will contain a data object which will have a JSON array of `clientUsername` objects. For large collections the response will be paged. See [SEMP paging]({{ site.docs-concepts-paging }}){:target="_top"} for details.

```
{
    "data":[
        {
            "aclProfileName":"#acl-profile",
            "clientProfileName":"#client-profile",
            "clientUsername":"#client-username",
            "enabled":true,
            "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
            "msgVpnName":"default",
            "subscriptionManager":false
        },
        {
            "aclProfileName":"default",
            "clientProfileName":"default",
            "clientUsername":"default",
            "enabled":true,
            "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
            "msgVpnName":"default",
            "subscriptionManager":false
        },
        {
            "aclProfileName":"default",
            "clientProfileName":"default",
            "clientUsername":"tutorialUser",
            "enabled":true,
            "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
            "msgVpnName":"default",
            "subscriptionManager":false
        }
    ],
    "links":[
        {
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/%23client-username"
        },
        {
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/default"
        },
        {
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
        }
    ],
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"GET",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
}
```

For developers, you can also notice that for collections, the links object will also be a JSON array containing the links for each `clientUsername` object.

## Partially updating an object using PATCH

The HTTP PATCH method allows you to partially update a SEMP object, only the attributes that are specified are updated. So let’s disable the `tutorialUser` Client Username as an example of how PATCH can be used. The URI is the same as the GET, it is the specific address of the `tutorialUser` object. In the JSON body, you specify all attributes that you want updated. In this case just `enabled` and we will send a value of `false`.

```
curl -X PATCH  -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled":false}'
```

The response back from the Solace message router will again have the same format as the GET response. In the response, the object is still returned and in this case, you can see that the object is now disabled: `"enabled":false`. 

```
  {
    "data":{
        "aclProfileName":"default",
        "clientProfileName":"default",
        "clientUsername":"tutorialUser",
        "enabled":false,
        "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
        "msgVpnName":"default",
        "subscriptionManager":false
    },
    "links":{
        "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
    },
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"PATCH",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
```

## Fully updating an object using PUT

The HTTP PUT method is used to update an object to match the attributes specified. All attributes not specified are reset to default values. Again, the URI for the `tutorialUser` Client Username is the same URI as used in the GET and PATCH. For the purposes of an example, let’s reset the `tutorialUser` so that it is enabled and all other attributes are defaulted. The following `curl` would do this:

```
curl -X PUT  -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientUsername":"tutorialUser","enabled":true}'
```

As with other methods, the response format contains the meta, links, and data. In the data object, the full Client Username is represented. You can see that it is now enabled.

```
{
    "data":{
        "aclProfileName":"default",
        "clientProfileName":"default",
        "clientUsername":"tutorialUser",
        "enabled":true,
        "guaranteedEndpointPermissionOverride":false,
        "msgVpnName":"default",
        "subscriptionManager":false
    },
    "links":{
        "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
    },
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"PUT",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
}  
```
       
## Removing an object using DELETE

The HTTP DELETE method is used to remove an object. No content is required. All the details are provided in the URI. The following curl will delete the `tutorialUser` Client Username object.

    curl -X DELETE  -u user:password solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser

In contrast to other methods, for the delete only the meta object is returned. The object is deleted from the system by the time the method returns.

```
{
    "meta":{
        "request":{
            "method":"DELETE",
            "uri":"http://solacevmr:8080/SEMP/v2/config/msgVpns/default/clientUsernames/tutorialUser"
        },
        "responseCode":200
    }
}
```

## Summary

At this point, you have created, retrieved, updated and deleted a Client Username object using SEMP. The examples used `curl` to send and receive the HTTP requests, but you can adapt the steps to any programming language of your choice. 

SEMP is an extensive API that lets you configure anything on your Solace message router so there is a lot more to understand. If you want to know more, either you can get more familiar with the SEMP concepts by checking out the [user guide]({{ site.docs-overview }}){:target="_top"} or you can see the full [developer documentation for the API]({{ site.docs-api }}){:target="_top"}.
