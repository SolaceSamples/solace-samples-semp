    <!-- Introduce the samples with some text. Below is an example. -->
    <p>These tutorials will get you up to speed and sending messages with Solace technology as quickly as possible. Here is a ways you can get started:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong class="rally-rte-class-0ab8d65e2">If your company has Solace message routers deployed</strong>, contact your middleware team to obtain the host name or IP address of a Solace message router to test against, a username and password to access it, and a VPN in which you can produce and consume messages.</li>
      <!--<li><strong>If you do not have access to a Solace message router,</strong> you will need to go through the "<a href="http://dev.solacesystems.com/get-started/vmr-setup-tutorials/setting-up-solace-vmr/" target="_top">Set up a VMR</a>" tutorial to download and install the software.</li>-->
    </ol>

    <p>
      <strong class="rally-rte-class-0ab8d65e2">Note:</strong> Currently SEMP v2 is only supported on Solace message router appliances running SolOS version 7.2.2 and above. Solace virtual message router will add SEMP v2 support in the near future.
