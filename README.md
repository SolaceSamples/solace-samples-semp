# Getting Started Examples
## Solace Element Management Protocol (SEMP)

These tutorials will get you up to speed and managing Solace message routers with SEMP as quickly as possible. 

If you are new to SEMP, you can learn more here for full documentation and API reference:

* [SEMP Docs](https://docs.solace.com/SEMP/Using-SEMP.htm#mc-main-content)
* [SEMP API Reference](https://docs.solace.com/SEMP/SEMP-API-Ref.htm)

These tutorials apply to the SEMP API starting in version 2. For older versions of the SEMP API, you can see the [Legacy SEMP Documentation](https://docs.solace.com/SEMP/Using-Legacy-SEMP.htm)

**Note**: SEMP v2 is supported on Solace virtual message routers and Solace message router appliances running SolOS version 7.2.2 and above.

It is best to view the associated [tutorials home page](https://tutorials.solace.dev/semp).

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites. 

## Building and running the Samples

Refer to the README.md in the [`java`](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-semp/tree/master/java), [`python`](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-semp/tree/master/python) and [`ruby`](https://github.com/SolaceSamples/solace-samples-semp/tree/master/ruby) subdirectories for a short description of how to build and run the samples for the programming languages.

To try individual samples, see the tutorials linked from the [tutorials home page](https://tutorials.solace.dev/semp) for full details which can walk you through the samples, what they do, and how to correctly run them to explore SEMP.
